# project
First, for the Bluetooth Scan project, setup the Bluetooth scan application and test its functions of how it performs scanning and collects information. When ready, conduct the scanning and record the measured RSSIs, device names, farthest estimated distance, Bluetooth packet types, PHY channel used while advertising, and check if the message was connectable.  Second, for the Wi-Fi Network Analyzer experiments, setup the network analyzer app and test its functions. Then conduct the measurements and record the device’s internal and external IP addresses and gateway’s IP address, link data rate that the AP provides, PHY channel and bandwidth you are using, number of detectable Wi-Fi channel signals and the strongest and weakest signal strength detected. In addition, conduct a Ping to the gateway and record the results.  Third, for the Amazon EC2 project, after setting up your AWS cloud, attempt two EC2 cloud services and see what you can do with them. In your report, explain the two EC2 cloud services you used and the results you obtained.
